    <h2>Mika's Background</h2>
    <p>Mika was adopted from the Ventura County Animal Services shelter in Camarillo, CA. Despite being an older and
      "less desirable" dog, she sparked an immense amount of joy and was adopted without a second thought. Since then,
      she has continued to enrich our lives every day. Her hobbies include barking at other dogs, eating treats, texting
      on her "cell phone", going on walks, and SLEEPING. Mika splits her time between Boston, MA and Oxnard, CA -
      staying in whichever climate is warmest for her little paws. Being the spoiled dog that she is, she is always
      receiving new outfits and as much love as any dog could hope for. Thanks for visiting this site, and enjoy your
      stay!
